# Userscripts

A bunch of tampermonkey userscripts to make work life a bit easier

# Usage

Each userscript has a commented out ===Userscript=== header. This header must copied as-is to a new userscript on the tampermonkey UI.
The header uses @require tags to load javascript files from disk - if the location has changed, amend the header

> make sure to have `Allow access to file URLs` enabled in your browsers extension settings for Tampermonkey
